# Project Explanation: Resume Category Classifier

## Why I Built This

Recruiters often deal with hundreds or thousands of resumes for different job roles. Manually screening each resume to understand the candidateâ€™s domain (e.g., Data Science, Accounting, Aviation) is slow, inefficient, and error-prone.

I wanted to automate this first layer of screening by building a Resume Category Classifier that can:
- Understand raw resume content
- Predict the most likely job domain based on skills, tools, and job history
- Help recruiters or job portals in routing resumes more intelligently

This project also allowed me to apply practical NLP and machine learning skills to solve a real-world HR tech problem.

## How It Works

### 1. Text Preprocessing
- Resumes are cleaned using a custom `cleanResume()` function.
- This removes emails, URLs, special characters, and normalizes whitespace.
- Keywords like known skills (Python, SAP, Tableau, etc.) are emphasized to improve model learning.

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Cleaned resumes are converted into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
- This captures important terms and term frequency across resumes.

### 3. Model Training
- A **Logistic Regression** model (or SVM) is trained to classify resumes into predefined categories (e.g., Software Engineer, Accountant, Aviation, etc.).
- Class imbalance is handled using `RandomOverSampler` from `imbalanced-learn`.

### 4. Evaluation
- The model is evaluated using cross-validation and tested on unseen resumes.
- Performance is measured using accuracy and classification report.

### 5. Prediction
- New resume input is cleaned, vectorized, and passed to the trained model.
- Output is the predicted job category label.
